#What can I check with this script?

for the moment you can check:

*uptime of the computer
*username
*kernel versions
*CPU temperature
*amount of RAM
*USB devices connected to the computer

The script is under active development, it is not the final version

#how to use the script?

download the .sh file, read it before enabling, and to enable the script use the command

sh ./lundiagnosis_beta.sh 

in the same directory where you downloaded the file

if you are annoyed by the constant refreshing of the terminal every second you can change this value (at the end of the script in sleep)
